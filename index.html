          <h2>problem statement</h2>

          <p>Since the early 20th century, minorities have been underrepresented in the Hollywood film industry due to a
            sense of familiarity towards white, male actors, resulting in less diversity and more white-led motion
            pictures. Only <i><b>20%</b></i> of Oscar winners in the past decade were awarded to people of color.</p>


          <h2>harmful effects on minorities</h2>

          <p>Not only does the lack of diversity deter non-white actors and actresses from breaking into the industry,
            but it also determines how people view minorities, which may include negative stereotypes. As a result,
            people of color have less of a chance to share their culture and stories through motion pictures.</p>
          <b></b>
          <p>Furthermore, movie studios such as Marvel and DC have many cases of whitewashing their own characters in
            movies. One popular example is Wanda Maximoff, who is originally Romani in the comics but is portrayed by
            Elizabeth Olsen, a white actress. Another wide-known example is Ra's al Ghul from Christopher Nolan's Batman
            trilogy. Although he is described as Arabic in the comics, he is represented in the live-action by Liam
            Neeson, another white actor.</p>

          <h2>disparity within award shows</h2>

          <p>In a census conducted on all nominations in the Oscars from 1928 to 2020, an estimated <mark>6%</mark>  of winners were
            people of color, while the rest predominantly consisted of white individuals.</p>

          <p>Moreover, men were nominated <mark>four times as much</mark> as women in the Oscars, which includes categories such as
